For this project I used the encapsulation principle by having different and seperate classes for Address, Product, Order and even Customer. Each class encaptulates the functions and the behavior and maintains it internally. Address keeps track of the addresses that are being entered into the system and prints them. The Order keeps track of the items as a whole and calculates the price and total. Products keeps track of what items are being put into the cart and customer keeps track of the customer. There is also a method of checking if the address is in the USA. This allows for the code to be maintainable and reusuable.
